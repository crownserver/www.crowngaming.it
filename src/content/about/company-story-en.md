## Our Mission

CrownGaming was born from a passion for gaming and the belief that every gaming community deserves superior server infrastructure. We believe gaming is more than a hobby: it's a passion that connects people worldwide, and it deserves professional, reliable, and high-performance hosting.

## Where We Come From

Our story begins in 2025, when four young tech professionals passionate about technology and gaming came together with a common goal: to create hosting solutions designed specifically for gamers, not adapted from generic services.

Alex Massaroni, a developer with years of experience building scalable cloud infrastructure, met Matteo Munetti and Matteo Fiacco, two system administrators with a shared passion for performance optimization and system security. They were joined by Nicolò Ceccarelli, a community management and digital marketing expert who shared the vision of creating a service designed for gamers.

All four of us are active gamers who have experienced firsthand the frustrations of traditional hosting services: sudden lag, technical support that doesn't understand gaming needs, complicated configurations, and unclear pricing.

## Our Values

### Performance Without Compromise
In gaming, every millisecond counts. We invest in latest-generation hardware and network optimizations to guarantee the best possible performance.

### Advanced Protection
Your server is the heart of your community. Advanced DDoS protection, automated backups, and proactive monitoring are standard, not optional.

### Gaming Expert Support
Our team doesn't just manage servers: we're gamers who understand your needs. 24/7 technical support from people who speak your language.

### Total Transparency
Clear pricing, no hidden costs, detailed documentation. What you see is what you get, always.

## The Future

Our goal is to become the reference point in Italy for gaming server hosting. We're preparing infrastructure for Minecraft and Hytale, with expansion plans for other popular games.
