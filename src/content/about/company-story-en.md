## Our Mission

CrownServer was born from the idea that cloud technology should be accessible to everyone, not just large companies. We believe every family and small business deserves to have their data safe, protected, and always accessible, without needing to be tech experts.

## Where We Come From

Our story begins in 2025, when four young tech professionals came together with a common goal: to create IT services designed for people and small businesses, not just large corporations.

Alex Massaroni, a developer with years of experience in cloud solutions development, met Matteo Munetti and Matteo Fiacco, two sysadmins with a shared passion for infrastructure and system security. They were joined by Nicolò Ceccarelli, a digital marketing expert who shared the vision of making technology more accessible and understandable.

Having worked in the tech industry, we had seen too many complicated services, confusing interfaces, and non-transparent pricing. We wanted to do things differently.

## Our Values

### Simplicity
We believe technology should be invisible. Our services are designed to be so simple that anyone can use them, from grandma to grandkid.

### Security
Your data is precious. We use the most advanced encryption technologies and maintain the highest security standards to protect your privacy.

### Transparency
No hidden costs, no fine print clauses. What you see is what you get, always.

### Local Support
We're an Italian company, with servers in Europe and a dedicated local support team. We understand your needs and are always ready to help.

## The Future

Our goal is ambitious: to become fully independent by 2027, offering top-quality infrastructure consulting, system support, and web hosting services. We want to be the reference point for Italian families and small businesses looking for reliable, secure, and easy-to-use IT solutions.
